# MONTY-AI
MONTY is a Python-based voice-only AI assistant that works entirely through speech with no keyboard input. Activated using the wake word “Monty,” it can answer questions, tell time and date, perform calculations, check weather, open websites, and respond using natural text-to-speech for a hands-free assistant experience.
